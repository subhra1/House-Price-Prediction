# House-Price-Prediction
#Introduction: 
House price forecasting is an important topic of real estate. The literature attempts to derive useful knowledge from historical data of property markets. Machine learning techniques are applied to analyse historical property transactions in Melbourne to discover useful models for house buyers and sellers.
#Aim:
•	Create an effective price prediction model
•	Validate the model’s prediction accuracy
•	Identify the important home price attributes which feed the model’s predictive power.
#Data
The data used in this project is web scrapped from Kaggle containing 34857 records and 21 data variables. 
#Methods
Decision Tree Regressor, KNN, Lasso and Ridge Regressor and Gradient Boosting are used to check the accuracy of each model.
House_Price_prediction.ipynb file gives a detailed step by step information about how to run the code.
#Deployment
Flask web framework was used to visualise the output prediction of the model based on the input variables.
